# DofusLab Items

This repository is to facilitate updating DofusLab's data from [Survival's tools](https://docs.dofusdu.de/), particularly [doduda](https://github.com/dofusdude/doduda) for extracting client data, and then using scripts here to transform them to DofusLab's format.

## Running

First, copy the extracted data into the appropriate `input` directory.

Then, run the appropriate `transform_*.py` script.

You can find your output in the the `output` directory.
